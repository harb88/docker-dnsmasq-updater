# Nuitka hints

These Nuitka hint files are generated by _Dockerfile.binary-hints_ (via `./build.sh hints`). In theory these files should be able to be imported and used for the Nuitka build in _Dockerfile.binary_, but they're slightly incomplete and thus don't work as they should. (Although they're only missing `_virtualenv`, so not far off being complete).

Also, even though they're each generated for a different architecture, they're all the same. So there's no real benefit in doing the QEMU magic to generate them. :) It's probably not necessary to run it for more than a single architecture, and the host architecture native build will run fastest.

The binary build itself uses _dnsmasq_updater-nuitka-hints.json_ for everything, which has the manual additions that are required. That file can be manually updated from the files generated here when necessary (e.g. upon Python or Nuitka version change).
